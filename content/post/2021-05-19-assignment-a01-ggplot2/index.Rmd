1. Introduction:

  In this post, the solution for assignment 01 is provided. I selected "Titanic" dataset because it consists of both Numerical and Categorical data.
  This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on of the ocean liner ‘Titanic’. This dataset has four variables: economic status (class), sex, age, and survival.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(datasets)
#head(Titanic)

ChickWeight <- ChickWeight
levels(ChickWeight$Diet) <- c("Diet 1","Diet 2","Diet 3","Diet 4")

cw_summary <-  filter(ChickWeight, (Time == 0) | (Time == 21)) %>%
  group_by(Diet, Time) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(weight),se = sd(weight)/(sqrt(n()))) 

# Let's take a peek at the data--
head(cw_summary)

cw_summary$Time <- as.factor(cw_summary$Time) 

ggplot(cw_summary, aes(x=Diet, y=Mean, fill=Time)) + # aesthetics
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +# geom for bar plots
  # scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=Mean-se, ymax=Mean+se), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9))  #geom for error bars
```
